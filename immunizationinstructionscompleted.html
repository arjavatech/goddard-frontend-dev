                    <div class="p-4">
                        <p>Please provide your child’s immunization records to the school on or before
                            your child’s
                            first day in our school . You can ask your doctor's office to fax the
                            immunization records to
                            the school fax number: 425-882-1833 or you can get the immunization record
                            from the
                            doctor's office in the state's CIS form found in the next page and sign the
                            form.</p>
                        <p>We have heard from few popular pediatric centers (e.g. Allegro Pediatrics)
                            that they
                            might no longer fax immunization records directly to third parties. In that
                            case, please
                            ask the office to email it to you. You can then forward it to us.
                            Alternatively, you can
                            use self service method to fetch the CIS form yourself at www.myir.net. It
                            will require
                            one time registration and authentication.</p>
                        <p>If you have an exemption due to medical or religious reasons. Please let us
                            know and we
                            will help provide the proper form to fill out.
