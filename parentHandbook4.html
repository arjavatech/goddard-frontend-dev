                <h5 class="text-center mb-4"><b>Addressing Individual Child Concerns</b></h5>
                <p>The Goddard School® has developed a strong working relationship with Kindering, an early intervention center serving urban East King County. Kindering is the largest intervention center in Washington, on e of the three largest in the nation, and notably the most comprehensive. The Educational Consultants at Kindering are committed to providing superior, individualized, family-centered services for children throughout the Eastside.<br><br>
                    Whenever there is a question about a child’s development or behavior, our first question is to ask if the environment can be modified to better accommodate the child’s needs. Kindering has been very helpful to our staff in making adjustments to our classrooms to better meet children’s needs. When the environmental changes are not enough, we then explore individual concerns. If the assessment process informs us of a specific need, the parents meet with the Educational Consultant, as well as, the Director and classroom teachers. Our conversation is designed to build a strong partnership between home, school and outside services that may benefit the child.<br><br>
                    Kindering can become a strong support for the family and provide referral services when appropriate. This is a free service and we are appreciative of the input that Kindering provides and the support they give to our program.</p>
                <h5 class="text-center mb-4"><b>Parent Code of Conduct</b></h5>
                <p>The Goddard School® expects parents to observe a certain standard of conduct at the center and on its grounds. The following items are not acceptable in the facility or on the grounds:</p>
                <ul class="p-5 pt-0 mb-0">
                    <li>Physical or verbal punishment of their children</li>
                    <li>Physical or verbal punishment of other children</li>
                    <li>Threatening or intimidating staff, other parents, or other children</li>
                    <li>Swearing/cursing or threatening/obscene gestures</li>
                    <li>Quarreling with other parents or staff</li>
                    <li>Not following policies designated to protect the safety and security of everyone in thecenter</li>
                </ul>
                <h5 class="text-center mb-4"><b>Parent Communication</b></h5>
                <p>The Goddard School® provides many opportunities for parents to receive information on the progress of their children, as well as details on other general activities occurring from time to time at the school. Examples of the types of communication that parents will receive include:</p>
                <h6><b>Kaymbu</b></h6>
                <p>A written daily report for each child in The Goddard School® provides a parent with an overview of the activities in which the child participated, as well as information on meals, sleep, and toileting will be emailed to you via KAYMBU (you can also download the App).</p>
                <h6><b>Parent Conferences</b></h6>
                <p>At least twice a year, or more often by parent (or staff) request, a formal parent/teacher conference time is scheduled. Our school is closed for the two scheduled conference dates, sign ups occur for families with siblings first and then open to the remaining classmates. These meetings serve to summarize each child’s progress in detail. The parent will be given a written developmental report, which summarizes the teacher’s evaluation.</p>
                <h6><b>Information Boards</b></h6>
                <p>Boards are located outside each classroom or inside the classroom by the door for your convenience. Information is provided about upcoming school and community events, as well as miscellaneous points of interest. Individual classroom boards will contain lesson plans, class schedules, and staff hours. It is recommended that parents check the boards regularly for updates and new information.</p>
                <h6><b>Daily Feedback</b></h6>
                <p>Daily communication will occur between staff and parents in the morning and evening to provide updates on the children’s health, disposition, etc. A long dialogue may not be possible at the drop-off or pick-up time, as these are particularly busy times when staff is responsible for supervising all of the children in their care. If you have a concern, a special appointment is advised or telephone conferences may be arranged.</p>
                <h6><b>Newsletters and Monthly Calendars</b></h6>
                <p>Monthly newsletters are emailed out to keep parents posted on all school activities. Monthly calendars will be available on or before the first of each month. These will be emailed out to all families a few days before the new month begins.</p>

                <p>The Owner and/or Director reserve the right to deny, cancel, sever, suspend, or terminate the services of any child, without notice, for any reason, so long as the determination in not based on whole or part on the race, color, creed, religion, sexual preference, age, gender, national origin, or disability or any other protected characteristic of the child or the child’s parents. At all times we strive to provide quality care for all children. If that quality is diminished by one child, the Director and/or Owner may ask for the dismissal of that child for the well-being of the other children in the room. Any unused tuition will be refunded minus any outstanding charges.<br><br>
                    The Goddard School® will not release a child to any parent, relative, or other authorized adult who appears to be impaired. In the event this situation is suspected, a telephone call will be made to the other parent, emergency contact person, local authorities and the Washington State Department of Child Protective Services in Washington and notify them of our suspicions.<br><br>
                    In the event that child abuse is suspected, we are required by the State of Washington to report any and all instances of suspected child abuse or neglect. When a staff member has information or evidence of suspected child abuse, the Director and/or Owner will be informed and the Department of Child Protective Services is contacted and given this information.<br><br>
                    The Goddard School® reserves the right to edit any of the information contained in this manual at any time, and the material contained herein should not be considered as sole determination of policy.<br><br>

                    <li>In-place sheltering: Sudden occurrences, weather or hazardous materials related, maydictate that taking cover inside the building is the best immediate response.</li>
                    <li>Evacuation: Total evacuation of the facility may become necessary. Parents will becontacted by telephone, as to the location of the children, or by radio broadcast ifphone transmission is not possible. In this case, the children will be taken to arelocation facility.</li>
