                        <p>The Goddard School takes photos of individual children and
                            groups of children for electronic daily activity reports. These photos

                            Systems, Inc. Although we have a School policy against it, it is
                            possible for individuals who receive group photos in an electronic daily
                            activity reports to share these group photos through their personal
                            social media accounts. For this reason, we ask that you specifically
                            authorize whether we can include your child in any group photos shared
                            through the electronic daily activity reports.</p>
