                            <p>The owners and staff at The Goddard School® do all we can to promote
                                a healthy environment for your children.
                                Our teachers make sure children wash their hands before meals, after
                                art projects, after toileting and diapering,
                                after coming in from outside, and after wiping one's nose. Our
                                teachers are required to wash their hands before
                                serving meals or snacks and are sure to wear latex gloves while
                                diapering or assisting a child with toileting and
                                when coming into contact with any bodily fluids. In addition, we
                                disinfect infant and toddler toys on a daily basis.
                                Our preschool toys are disinfected weekly.</p>
                            <p>The health of the children is very important to the staff at The
                                Goddard School®. Children who are ill cannot be
                                appropriately cared for in a childcare setting. A child who is
                                unable to participate due to illness should not be in
                                attendance. The Goddard School® staff understands that it may be
                                difficult to make alternate arrangements
                                when a child may be too ill to attend the program. However,
                                cooperation in keeping a child home when they
                                are showing symptoms of illness will be greatly appreciated by the
                                teachers and all the children who would
                                normally be in contact with that child. By establishing and
                                maintaining a healthy environment and reasonable
                                health policies, all of our children will benefit.</p>
                            <p>If a child does arrive in the morning showing signs of ill health, we
                                will be unable to accept him/her. The
                                exception to this requirement would be that a licensed physician has
                                examined the child and indicated, in
                                writing, that there would be no health risk to your child or others,
                                and the child is capable of participating in all
                                activities, including outdoor play. </p>
                            <h4>Examples of health symptoms that require exclusion from the program

                                    body/scalp</li>

                                <li>Skin rashes (excluding diaper rash) especially with fever or
                                    itching</li>

                                </li>
                                <li> Blood/pus from ears, skin, urine, stool</li>
                                <li>Unusual behavior characterized by listlessness, loss of normal
                                    appetite, or confusion</li>

                            </ul>
                            <p>If a child becomes ill during the day, a parent will be advised
                                immediately. The child will be given the opportunity
                                to rest or have other activities in a separated, supervised area
                                until a designated release person can pick up the
                                child. If the child is not picked up within one hour from the time
                                of notification, the emergency contact person
                                will be called. Children who are sent home due to illness will not
                                be readmitted to the school until all signs of
                                illness have been gone for 24 hours. Therefore, a child who is sent
                                home ill cannot return to school the following
                                day. The exception to this requirement would be that a licensed
                                physician has examined the child and has
                                indicated in writing that the child does not present a health threat
                                to him/her or others and is able to participate
                                in all school activities, including outdoor play.</p>
                            <p>In cases of certain communicable diseases, The Goddard School® is
                                required to file a report with the Department
                                of Health within 24 hours, so control measures can be used. Parents
                                and staff are reminded to notify The
                                Goddard School® within 24 hours if a child or family member has
                                developed a known or suspected
                                communicable disease. If a child has not been fully immunized for
                                these diseases (due to the child's age, medical
                                condition, or religious belief) they will be excluded from the
                                school during the outbreak of a vaccine-preventable
                                disease, as directed by Washington State Department of Health.
                                Examples of "Reportable Diseases" include (but
