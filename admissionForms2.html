                        <p>The owners and staff at The Goddard School® do all we can to promote
                            a healthy environment for your children.
                            Our teachers make sure children wash their hands before meals, after
                            art projects, after toileting and diapering,
                            after coming in from outside, and after wiping one's nose. Our
                            teachers are required to wash their hands before
                            serving meals or snacks and are sure to wear latex gloves while
                            diapering or assisting a child with toileting and
                            when coming into contact with any bodily fluids. In addition, we
                            disinfect infant and toddler toys on a daily basis.
                            Our preschool toys are disinfected weekly.</p>
                        <p>The health of the children is very important to the staff at The
                            Goddard School®. Children who are ill cannot be
                            appropriately cared for in a childcare setting. A child who is
                            unable to participate due to illness should not be in
                            attendance. The Goddard School® staff understands that it may be
                            difficult to make alternate arrangements
                            when a child may be too ill to attend the program. However,
                            cooperation in keeping a child home when they
                            are showing symptoms of illness will be greatly appreciated by the
                            teachers and all the children who would
                            normally be in contact with that child. By establishing and
                            maintaining a healthy environment and reasonable
                            health policies, all of our children will benefit.</p>
                        <p>If a child does arrive in the morning showing signs of ill health, we
                            will be unable to accept him/her. The
                            exception to this requirement would be that a licensed physician has
                            examined the child and indicated, in
                            writing, that there would be no health risk to your child or others,
                            and the child is capable of participating in all
                            activities, including outdoor play. </p>
                        <h4>Examples of health symptoms that require exclusion from the program
                            include, but are not limited to:</h4>
                        <ul>

                        <p>If a child becomes ill during the day, a parent will be advised
                            immediately. The child will be given the opportunity
                            to rest or have other activities in a separated, supervised area
                            until a designated release person can pick up the
                            child. If the child is not picked up within one hour from the time
                            of notification, the emergency contact person
                            will be called. Children who are sent home due to illness will not
                            be readmitted to the school until all signs of
                            illness have been gone for 24 hours. Therefore, a child who is sent
                            home ill cannot return to school the following
                            day. The exception to this requirement would be that a licensed
                            physician has examined the child and has
                            indicated in writing that the child does not present a health threat
                            to him/her or others and is able to participate
                            in all school activities, including outdoor play.</p>
                        <p>In cases of certain communicable diseases, The Goddard School® is
                            required to file a report with the Department
                            of Health within 24 hours, so control measures can be used. Parents
                            and staff are reminded to notify The
                            Goddard School® within 24 hours if a child or family member has
                            developed a known or suspected
                            communicable disease. If a child has not been fully immunized for
                            these diseases (due to the child's age, medical
                            condition, or religious belief) they will be excluded from the
                            school during the outbreak of a vaccine-preventable
                            disease, as directed by Washington State Department of Health.
                            Examples of "Reportable Diseases" include (but
