                        <h6><b>General Information on Medications</b></h6>
                        <p>The Goddard School in Lynnwood administers only life-saving medication such as EPI-Pen’s, Benadryl, Inhalers, etc.<br><br>
                            The medication logs and authorization forms are located in the Director’s office. Authorization forms must be completed by the parent or guardian and given to the Director prior to any medication being administered. This will serve as a second method to ensure that your child receives his/her medication.<br><br>
                            Check expiration dates on all medications. We will not be able to administer expired medications even if the log and form are completed.<br><br>
                            Every medication needs to have a pharmacy label with the child’s first and last name printed on the bottle. Only one bottle may be used for each child. Siblings may not share containers of medication.<br><br>
                            Over-the-counter medications will not be given even with a doctor’s note.</p>
                        <h6><b>Request for Medication to be Dispensed</b></h6>
                        <p>No over-the-counter medication will be dispensed. All medication must be a prescription prescribed by doctor and have a pharmacy label and medication number. When a child needs medication, 2 forms must be completed. The first form is the medication log. The log needs to be completed each day the child is to receive medication. A parent must indicate a specific time and dosage of medication to be dispensed. Medication will not be dispensed on an “as needed” basis. The second form is the authorization for dispensing medication. Medication will only be dispensed for the dates indicated on the form. The authorization form should be given directly to the Director.</p>
                        <h6><b>Allergies That May Require Medication</b></h6>
                        <p>No over-the-counter medication will be dispensed. All medication must be a prescription prescribed by doctor and have a pharmacy label and medication number. When a child needs medication, 2 forms must be completed. The first form is the medication log. The log needs to be completed each day the child is to receive medication. A parent must indicate a specific time and dosage of medication to be dispensed. Medication will not be dispensed on an “as needed” basis. The second form is the authorization for dispensing medication. Medication will only be dispensed for the dates indicated on the form. The authorization form should be given directly to the Director.</p>
                        <h6><b>Allergies That May Require Medication</b></h6>
                        <p>If a child has an allergy which may require emergency medication, an authorization form must be on file. If it is determined that a child is in need of this emergency medication, a staff member will contact the parent, complete the medication log, and have the parent sign it upon their arrival at the school. A copy of the authorization form must be kept in the child’s file and with the medication. This medication may remain at school overnight. Authorization forms must be updated every six months.</p>
                        <h6><b>Topical Medications (Diaper Creams, Sun Screens, Etc.)</b></h6>
                        <p>If a child requires over-the-counter diaper ointments, lotions, lip balm, or sun screen, these must be labeled with the child’s first and last name. The parent must complete an authorization form for each type of ointment or lotion. This authorization is good for one year. If diaper ointment s are applied it will be noted on the child’s daily report. These ointments and lotions must be placed in a designated container in the teacher closet or cabinet and remain at school overnight.</p>
                        <h5 class="text-center mb-4"><b>Accidents and Injury</b></h5>
                        <p>Should a child become injured at school, the parent will be notified via an accident report form. In the event of an injury above the shoulders, an email notification or phone call will be made.
                            The parent will be asked to sign this form indicating that they have been notified, and a copy of
                            the form will be included in the child’s school record. If the injury is of a serious nature, a parent will receive a phone call from the school at the time the accident occurs.<br><br>
                            In the event of an emergency, the child will be transported via ambulance to the nearest hospital or emergency room facility and a parent will be contacted to meet an accompanying staff member at the facility. It is extremely important that emergency contact information for your child is up to date. A child cannot be transported for care, or receive any emergency care at school, unless the waivers for emergency care have been signed. These waivers are included in the enrollment packet.</p>

                        <h5 class="text-center mb-4"><b>Toys From Home</b></h5>
                        <p>It is recommended that all personal toys remain at home. It is very difficult for young children to share favorite possessions, and all toys that enter the school must be shared. In addition, many toys break easily and contain small parts. These types of toys may be inappropriate for our setting.<br><br>
                            Show and tell items may occasionally be requested by a child’s teacher. Suggested show and tell items include books, photographs, special treasures such as seashells, or theme related items.
                            These should be discussed with the teacher and items will be shown at the teacher’s discretion. Anything pertaining to violence (guns, war toys, etc.) or having to do with religious beliefs cannot be utilized at The Goddard School®. Material deemed inappropriate for a preschool audience will not be used. All electronic devices from home are not permitted at school.</p>
                        <h5 class="text-center mb-4"><b>Items to Bring to School</b></h5>
                        <h6><b>Infants</b></h6>
                        <p>Each infant is provided with their own crib and mattress upon enrollment. The parent must provide:</p>
                        <ul class="p-5 pt-0 mb-0">
                            <li>2-3 crib sheets (port-a-crib or play yard size)</li>
                            <li>A sleep sac when appropriate</li>
                            <li>2-3 complete changes of clothing for the appropriate season</li>
                            <li>Diapers and wipes, diaper cream if needed</li>
                            <li>All food, drink, and utensils required to serve food</li>
                            <li>Sweater or sweatshirt, mittens and hat</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Parents are responsible for washing the crib linens at least once a week. Diaper creams and lotions are considered medication and therefore must be accompanied by Goddard’s authorization form. All food, bottles, and clothing must be labeled with the child’s first and last name. Bottles and caps will need to be re-labeled frequently. Any items required for serving food such as spoons, bowls, cups, etc. must also be provided and labeled by the parent. Bottles must be filled at home, and brought to school ready to serve. We ask that you not send anything in glass jars or bottles. Refrigeration is provided for storing bottles and food.</p>
                        <h6><b>Toddlers and Preschoolers</b></h6>
                        <p>The parent must provide the following items for each toddler and/or preschooler:</p>
                        <ul class="p-5 pt-0 mb-0">
                            <li>Two full changes of clothing including socks and shoes</li>
                            <li>Meals must be provided daily in a labeled lunch box</li>
                            <li>Diapers and wipes, and/or extra sets of underwear if child is “in training”</li>
                            <li>A small blanket and sheet is requested for nap time and a favorite sleep toy may alsobe provided</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>All items brought to school should be conspicuously labeled with the child’s first and last name. Extra clothing should be provided as seasons change and as the child grows. Rubber soled, closed-toe shoes, such as sneakers, are the most appropriate shoe for daily activities, such as climbing, running, and playing outside. Appropriate outdoor apparel is needed daily, as every effort is made to have some outdoor play time, even in the winter months. Please label detachable clothing where possible (hoods on coats, clips on mittens); this will lessen missing items. Additional sets of clothing and appropriate underwear will be required when the child is “potty-training.” Blankets are sent home weekly to be laundered.</p>

                        <h5 class="text-center mb-4"><b>Rest Time</b></h5>
                        <p>Children in the Toddler and Preschool classes are required to lie quietly on their sleeping mats for approximately 30 – 45 minutes daily. This allows those children who do wish to sleep, a quiet length of time in which they may rest. Quiet music is played, the lights are dimmed, and it is a period of relaxation for both nappers and non-nappers. Those children who do not fall asleep during the initial quiet time are given the opportunity to select quiet activities such as books or puzzles to occupy themselves while their classmates rest. The Pre-Kindergarten classrooms are non-napping classes.<br><br>
                            Although we make every effort to meet each child’s rest needs, it is difficult to guarantee a specific length of nap time, or wake-up time, as a child’s rest needs vary with activity level, sleep patterns the night before, etc. It is equally difficult, and in opposition to our child-centered program, to keep a child awake if he/she wants to rest.<br><br>
                            Infants will rest on an individual schedule of time and length. Infants who cannot turn over on their own will be placed in the crib lying on their backs only unless a medical reason supported by a written physician’s note states otherwise.</p>
                        <h5 class="text-center mb-4"><b>Meals and Snacks</b></h5>
                        <p>The Goddard School® has found that parents prefer to provide lunch for their children. This way a parent can send a meal that meets their child’s individual needs and preferences. Children enrolled in the morning preschool program are encouraged to join their classmates for lunch and socialization. After lunch there is a natural break in the day for the morning children to depart, as the full day children prepare for rest time.<br><br>
                            The Goddard School® provides morning and afternoon snacks on a daily basis. These may include items such as crackers, Cheerios, pretzels, and graham crackers. Fresh fruits and vegetables will also be served on a weekly basis. Beverages may include water, milk or 100% fruit juice. The snack menu is posted in the kitchen and emailed out to parents at the beginning of each month.<br><br>
                            Parents of infants must send prepared bottles of breast milk or formula that is clearly labeled with the child’s first and last name, contents and date. Arrangements may be made for mothers who wish to come to the school to breast feed their infant. Instructions regarding a feeding schedule that has been established by the parent must be provided, and these schedules should be up-dated as necessary when new foods are introduced. Infant bottles will be reheated in a bottle warmer, shaken, and temperature tested before feeding. Any contents remaining in a bottle after a feeding will be discarded after 45minutes for breastmilk and 1 hour for formula, therefore it is suggested that bottles be filled with the amount the child will drink at each feeding. Small (4oz.) bottles may be more appropriate for a young infant.<br><br>
                            As solid foods are introduced, parents are requested to bring labeled containers or small containers of food. For the safety and protection of all our infants, no glass jars are allowed. Please send only plastic containers. All food should be portioned out in clean and sanitized containers. The date should also appear on the label, along with the child’s first and last name. All Infant food should be placed in the refrigerator in the individual box upon arrival. In warm weather, it is recommended that perishable food be transported in an insulated cooler. Any food or beverage not eaten at scheduled meal times must be discarded and noted on the child’s daily report. In the case of extra bottles/food for infants, any item that has not been opened will be saved until the end of the day. These bottles and/or food must be taken home at the end of each day.<br><br>
                            Breakfast from home may be provided for children who arrive prior to 8:00 AM. All food should be sent ready to serve. If any preparation is required, parents should plan to spend several minutes assisting their children, as the staff will be supervising both eating and play time.
                            Children who arrive after 8:00 AM should eat breakfast at home, as school activities at this point in the day do not allow for the supervision of children who are eating breakfast. A mid-morning snack is served between 9:00 AM and 10:00 AM daily.<br><br>
                            For lunch, sandwiches, yogurt, soup, fruit, crackers, cheese, etc. are recommended so that the children receive a serving from each food group. Please try to avoid foods that contain excessive amounts of sugar, preservatives, artificial flavorings, colors, or caffeine. Lunches should be ready to serve (fruit peeled, soup in a microwave-safe container, etc.). Items that require refrigeration must be labeled with the child’s first and last name and placed in the appropriate tray in the classroom. The trays will then be placed in the refrigerator in the kitchen.<br><br>
                            All bibs, bottles, cups, bowls, spoons, etc., must be taken home daily. Washington State Department of Health requirements do not allow us to wash and store these items. All items must be labeled with first and last names (no initials).<br><br>
                            Your child will be encouraged to eat the balanced meal that you have provided. However, if a child refuses certain foods, those choices will be respected and will remain in the child’s lunch box if unopened. Please review your child’s daily report for an indication of appetite and food consumption. We are unable to save opened food, our teachers do take a picture of their lunch after they are completed so that you can see what was eaten.</p>

                        <h6><b>Toddlers and Preschoolers</b></h6>
                        <p>The parent must provide the following items for each toddler and/or preschooler:</p>
                        <ul class="p-5 pt-0 mb-0">
                            <li>Two full changes of clothing including socks and shoes</li>
                            <li>Meals must be provided daily in a labeled lunch box</li>
                            <li>Diapers and wipes, and/or extra sets of underwear if child is “in training”</li>
                            <li>A small blanket and sheet is requested for nap time and a favorite sleep toy may alsobe provided</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>All items brought to school should be conspicuously labeled with the child’s first and last name. Extra clothing should be provided as seasons change and as the child grows. Rubber soled, closed-toe shoes, such as sneakers, are the most appropriate shoe for daily activities, such as climbing, running, and playing outside. Appropriate outdoor apparel is needed daily, as every effort is made to have some outdoor play time, even in the winter months. Please label detachable clothing where possible (hoods on coats, clips on mittens); this will lessen missing items. Additional sets of clothing and appropriate underwear will be required when the child is “potty-training.” Blankets are sent home weekly to be laundered.</p>

                        <h5 class="text-center mb-4"><b>Transition</b></h5>
                        <p>Children grow so fast and before you know, they are ready to move to the next classroom. The Goddard School® staff is trained to transfer the trust your child has in his/her current teachers and classrooms, on to the next. Prior to any transition, you will be notified in writing of your child’s successes and the need to graduate to the next level. When transitions take place, particularly in summer and fall, your child will likely be in the same class for approximately 9 month if they are Get Set, Toddler, Pre-Toddler or First Steps. Preschool and Prekindergarten classes are typically a full year. Periodically there will be a change that takes place in those classes, based on the needs of the building and you will be notified through a transition letter if that will take place. You are welcome to schedule a conference with either your current teacher(s) or the next classroom’s staff to discuss your child’s needs. The letter will inform you on how a transition works and how you can lend us a hand in making the experience a successful one. As children transition, their attendance is tracked in both classrooms to assure adult supervision.</p>
                        <h5 class="text-center mb-4"><b>Toilet Training Philosophy</b></h5>
                        <p>Toilet training is one of the many developmental skills children acquire between the ages of 2 ½ and 3. As a developmental skill, it will be reached in a child’s own time.<br><br>
                            The Goddard School’s® “Get Set” program has been designed and scheduled to provide ample opportunities to foster this skill. While focus remains on this developmental milestone, academic activities for older 2’s and young 3’s are presented and reinforced daily. Children will not transition into the Preschool classroom until they are potty-trained and wearing underwear “not a pull-up” throughout the whole length of the day. Potty-trained includes the ability to fully dress/undress themselves, proper wiping, communication of bathroom needs to teachers, and control during transitions of the day.<br><br>
                            During this process, diapers should be replaced by training pants or pull-ups, and then by regular underwear. As accidents are inevitable, a sufficient supply should be on hand, along with season appropriate clothing changes.</p>
                        <h5 class="text-center mb-4"><b>Field Trips</b></h5>
                        <p>As part of The Goddard School® program, periodic walking field trips will be planned to provide the children with exposure to learning experiences in our local community. Prior to each trip, information will be sent home outlining the date, time, cost, location, chaperones, etc. A permission slip is required and must be signed by a parent and returned to the supervising teacher by the date requested on the form. No child will be permitted to attend a field trip if the required permission slip is not on file. Children must be four (4) years of age or older to participate in walking field trips. Ratios for field trips are 1 teacher/staff member or chaperone per 5 children.</p>
                        <h5 class="text-center mb-4"><b>Celebration of a Child’s Birthday</b></h5>
                        <p>The celebration of a child’s birthday at school with their friends can be a wonderful lifetime memory. In planning these moments, please consider the nutritional needs and requirements of all the children in the class. Special treats must be store purchased and arrive at the school in their original store container. Please provide the teacher with advance notice of what will be brought, and coordinate the date and time with the teacher. We have a wonderful list of suggestions, please ask the Director or Owner for a copy.<br><br>
                            Please contact the Director or Owner for assistance in any special event planning at the school.</p>

                        <p>It is our desire that the environment around the children be as safe and healthy as possible. Therefore, The Goddard School® is a smoke-free environment, both inside the building and on school grounds. Parents, faculty, staff, and visitors are asked to comply with this request.</p>

                        <p>The Goddard School® will make every effort to open on time and remain open in the event of inclement weather. However, in the case of extremely dangerous road conditions or states of emergency, it may be necessary for the school to cancel school or delay the opening time or early dismissal. We will send Tadpoles, Emails and Text Messages out as soon as possible. Should parents be prevented by weather conditions from reaching the facility to pick up their children, please make plans for an alternate pick-up. Closing staff members will care for the children and maintain proper staff-child ratio, until such time as the parents can safely reach the school.<br><br>
                            Should the building require emergency evacuation, the staff-child ratios will be maintained and the children will be evacuated to a nearby location. Each staff member responsible for a group of children will carry emergency contact information and class attendance records with them to the new site. Parents will be contacted by telephone as to the location of the children, or by radio broadcast if phone transmission is not possible, depending on circumstances, parents may be requested to pick up their children, or arrange for the emergency contact person to pick up their children.</p>

                        <p>Out of concern for child safety, we do not permit the use of The Goddard School name or service mark, including logos, photographs of school grounds, and photographs of any child, parent, or employee of the school, to be posted on a web site, blog, or online social network without written permission from The Goddard School. If you wish to share information about The Goddard School in this manner please check with your on-site owner or school director. Wealso have a Social Media Policy if you would like a copy for your information.</p>
                        <h5 class="text-center mb-4"><b>Reporting of Suspected Child Abuse or Neglect</b></h5>
                        <p>Every school is required by law to notify state authorities if there is knowledge or suspicion of physical or sexual abuse of children in or outside of school. The Goddard School located in Lynnwood, WA complies with this law and cooperates with authorities in investigations.</p>
                        <h5 class="text-center mb-4"><b>Behavior Policy</b></h5>
                        <p>It is the policy of The Goddard School® to keep disciplinary issues minimized and to help children monitor their own behavior. The staff of The Goddard School® present and model age- appropriate behavioral guidelines and use reflective communication to encourage children to express their emotions. The staff encourages self-control, self-direction, responsibility, and cooperation. At this time practical and safe, logical or natural consequences will be presented to the child.<br><br>
                            The Goddard School® staff is trained in the process of positive discipline. Positive discipline instructs children as to what they should do. For example: “We walk inside the building” vs.
                            “No running!” This philosophy of behavior is in accordance with The Goddard School® belief that children learn best in an environment where love, guidance, and encouragement promote the development of self-esteem.<br><br>
                            “Quiet time” may be used selectively for children over 18 months of age who are at risk of harming themselves or others. “Quiet time” is used as a last resort after several attempts of redirection have been made. The period of “quiet time” will be just long enough to enable the child to regain control of him or herself and will never be longer than 1-2 minutes per year of age. During the “quiet time” period, the child will be in an area where they may be visually observed by a teacher/Director.<br><br>
                            Aggressive physical behavior (fighting, hitting, biting, etc.) by a child toward another child or staff member is unacceptable. Staff members will intervene immediately should this type of situation occur, in order to protect all of the children and encourage more acceptable behavior. Physical restraint (a teacher holding a child) will not be used except as necessary to ensure a child’s safety or that of others, and then only for as long as is necessary for control of the situation. Children will be shown positive alternatives rather than just being told “no”. Parents will be informed if such an incident occurs, and a conference may be requested at any time to discuss an acceptable behavioral plan. If at the discretion of The Goddard School® staff, a child’s behavior is determined to be uncontrollable, extremely disruptive, and/or harmful to their self or others, the parent will be called to come and remove the child from school for the day.
                            Parents will be required to make arrangements for the child to be picked up within 45 minutes from the call. Failure to do so may result in termination of services. The Goddard School® reserves the right to terminate enrollment of children who exhibit behavioral patterns, which are deemed to be harmful to themselves or others. The determination of what is harmful and/or appropriate is at the sole discretion of The Goddard School® staff. Open communication between home and school is considered key to effective discipline.<br><br>
                            At no time, at The Goddard School® will a child be subjected to physical corporal punishment (shaking, hitting, biting, pinching, etc.), humiliated, frightened, or verbally abused by our staff. Children will never be disciplined for sleep habits, toileting accidents, food consumption, or lack of participation in scheduled activities. At all times, a child’s age, emotional state, and past experiences will be considered in discipline matters. Any violation of the school’s discipline policy should be brought to the Director or Owner’s attention immediately.</p>

                        <h5 class="text-center mb-4"><b>Addressing Individual Child Concerns</b></h5>
                        <p>The Goddard School® has developed a strong working relationship with Kindering, an early intervention center serving urban East King County. Kindering is the largest intervention center in Washington, on e of the three largest in the nation, and notably the most comprehensive. The Educational Consultants at Kindering are committed to providing superior, individualized, family-centered services for children throughout the Eastside.<br><br>
                            Whenever there is a question about a child’s development or behavior, our first question is to ask if the environment can be modified to better accommodate the child’s needs. Kindering has been very helpful to our staff in making adjustments to our classrooms to better meet children’s needs. When the environmental changes are not enough, we then explore individual concerns. If the assessment process informs us of a specific need, the parents meet with the Educational Consultant, as well as, the Director and classroom teachers. Our conversation is designed to build a strong partnership between home, school and outside services that may benefit the child.<br><br>
                            Kindering can become a strong support for the family and provide referral services when appropriate. This is a free service and we are appreciative of the input that Kindering provides and the support they give to our program.</p>
                        <h5 class="text-center mb-4"><b>Parent Code of Conduct</b></h5>
                        <p>The Goddard School® expects parents to observe a certain standard of conduct at the center and on its grounds. The following items are not acceptable in the facility or on the grounds:</p>
                        <ul class="p-5 pt-0 mb-0">
                            <li>Physical or verbal punishment of their children</li>
                            <li>Physical or verbal punishment of other children</li>
                            <li>Threatening or intimidating staff, other parents, or other children</li>
                            <li>Swearing/cursing or threatening/obscene gestures</li>
                            <li>Quarreling with other parents or staff</li>
                            <li>Not following policies designated to protect the safety and security of everyone in thecenter</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5 class="text-center mb-4"><b>Parent Communication</b></h5>
                        <p>The Goddard School® provides many opportunities for parents to receive information on the progress of their children, as well as details on other general activities occurring from time to time at the school. Examples of the types of communication that parents will receive include:</p>
                        <h6><b>Kaymbu</b></h6>
                        <p>A written daily report for each child in The Goddard School® provides a parent with an overview of the activities in which the child participated, as well as information on meals, sleep, and toileting will be emailed to you via KAYMBU (you can also download the App).</p>
                        <h6><b>Parent Conferences</b></h6>
                        <p>At least twice a year, or more often by parent (or staff) request, a formal parent/teacher conference time is scheduled. Our school is closed for the two scheduled conference dates, sign ups occur for families with siblings first and then open to the remaining classmates. These meetings serve to summarize each child’s progress in detail. The parent will be given a written developmental report, which summarizes the teacher’s evaluation.</p>
                        <h6><b>Information Boards</b></h6>
                        <p>Boards are located outside each classroom or inside the classroom by the door for your convenience. Information is provided about upcoming school and community events, as well as miscellaneous points of interest. Individual classroom boards will contain lesson plans, class schedules, and staff hours. It is recommended that parents check the boards regularly for updates and new information.</p>
                        <h6><b>Daily Feedback</b></h6>
                        <p>Daily communication will occur between staff and parents in the morning and evening to provide updates on the children’s health, disposition, etc. A long dialogue may not be possible at the drop-off or pick-up time, as these are particularly busy times when staff is responsible for supervising all of the children in their care. If you have a concern, a special appointment is advised or telephone conferences may be arranged.</p>
                        <h6><b>Newsletters and Monthly Calendars</b></h6>
                        <p>Monthly newsletters are emailed out to keep parents posted on all school activities. Monthly calendars will be available on or before the first of each month. These will be emailed out to all families a few days before the new month begins.</p>

                            <li>Immediate evacuation: Students are evacuated to a safe area on the grounds of thefacility in the event of a fire, etc.</li>
                            <li>In-place sheltering: Sudden occurrences, weather or hazardous materials related, maydictate that taking cover inside the building is the best immediate response.</li>
                            <li>Evacuation: Total evacuation of the facility may become necessary. Parents will becontacted by telephone, as to the location of the children, or by radio broadcast ifphone transmission is not possible.
